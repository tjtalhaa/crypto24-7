            <p class='sspadding'>Hello, I am known by Muhammad Talha Khalid. I'm a software engineer with experience in c#, c++ and python.
                    During my academia, I created a few websites in asp.net that created my passion for websites. 
                    Right Now I am learning hard to be a full-stack engineer with gaining experience in Express JS, Node JS, MongoDB and React</p>
                
            <p class='sspadding'>My dream is to one day start my own business and become an entrepreneur. I have few ideas but as usual, they need financial assistance (working on that)</p>
                
            <p class='sspadding'>I'm constantly in quest of learning new things. Currently, those things include gaining more experience with MongoDB, React, Express JS, and Node JS. 
                    Along with that, I am looking forward to a master degree in computer science(MSCS), as I enjoyed learning and developing basic projects in 
                    machine learning and artificial intelligence</p>
                
            <p class='sspadding'>Right now I am working on the React website with all the content coming from the database. I had developed one long time ago with static but responsive content. However, this time I am bringing up games to the next level by making it as dynamic as I can </p>
                
            <p class='sspadding'>I had a terrible accident a few months ago that has crushed me to the core both physically and emotionally but 
                    as older folk say these hardships are like hard reset to one's life by GOD.
            </p>
